                <h1>A-boot.</h1>
             	<p>This is a boot. Not really. This as a final reflection and conclusion on this website/course. For your general convenience, have a list:</p>
                <ol>
                	<li>The color scheme has handpicked personally (with some help from the kuler) with the intention of it being on the borderline between acceptable and annoying. </li>
                    <li>Yes, I do realise the video was no longer a requirement for the final project. I just couldn't help myself.</li>
                    <li>The senses pages basically originated from the fact I spent half a day chuckling about the idea of talking about smelly websites.</li>
                    <li>I shall pray to the unnammed gods of the north so that you may find the "sense of humour" more charming than annoying. Or to the seven, if you follow those. Oh, the firelord you say? Yes, yes definetively that guy. I will totally pray to him. Night is dark and all that... Please dont burn me!</li>
                	<li>And last, but definitively not least, my gratitude. Thank you so much for this course, for teaching us (me) in such a cool and close manner. I believe (hope) every single person in this class has emerged from it with a small boat of knowledge, just enough for us to set sail into the ocean of web development. I certainly did. Thank you!</li>
                </ol>
