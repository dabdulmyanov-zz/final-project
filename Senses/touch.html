                <h1>Touch</h1>
             	<p> Touch is an interesting sense in itself. We associate it to our hands, school textbooks being at fault, but it is present all over our body, with varying intensity. It helps us feel the breeze, and the cold, the softness of a lovers caress, the weight of whatever you are carrying right now. It is such a generic sense, that so many physical sensations have to be placed under it, unless you wish them discarded.</p>
                <p>But what is touch in the internet? Nothing you may rush to say. And I can both agree and disagree with you. You can't really <i>feel</i> the Internet yet, but does that mean that you truly only experience it through hearing and sight? I presume that the best way to reflect upon this point is with an example. Imagine yourself with your common scrollbar, so common that you intuitively already know what will happen if you click on it and drag it. But imagine now the scenario that you do that... but the scrollbar moves slower than usual, for no perceptible reason. It just does, even if you drag your cursor further. It probably creates a sense of weight, of heavyness, similar to what you feel when you grab an object that seems lighter than it actually is. And suddenly, you realise, you felt something. </p>
