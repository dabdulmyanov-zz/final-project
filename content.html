                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adip... just kidding. Content! Content is the thing that makes you come to a website in the first place, isn't it? If youÂ´re on the web, you are looking for something, though sometimes you don't even know what you are looking for. It's okay, the internet has got your back - that's what lolcat pages are for.</p>
                
                <p>However, why would you ever create content for the sake of content? This phenomena has been observed lately quite a bit, all around the network. "You must be on twitter!". "Where is your blog?". "Consumer reach is your new <b>GOD!</b>" (I may have overstated that last one.) Yes, reaching out to your public is important. Probably even more important than reaching to your potential public. But don't talk unless you have something to say. </p>
                
                <p><i>"Wise men speak because they have something to say; Fools because they have to say something." -  Plato</i></p>
